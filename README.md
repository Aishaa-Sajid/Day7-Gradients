# Day7-Gradients
Overview
This repository showcases my learning progress on Day 7 of the #100DaysofWeb challenge. The focus for today was on exploring and implementing various CSS styling techniques, particularly gradients, the powerful @property at-rule, and media queries for responsive design.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate practical applications of these CSS features, building upon previous learning in animation, transform, transition, and Grid layouts.

Concepts Explored
Gradients:
Linear Gradients (linear-gradient()): Creating smooth color transitions along a straight line.
Radial Gradients (radial-gradient()): Generating circular or elliptical color transitions radiating from a central point.
Conic Gradients (conic-gradient()): Producing color transitions around a central point, like a pie chart.
@property (CSS Custom Properties):
Defining custom CSS properties with specified syntax, initial values, and inheritance.
Leveraging @property to make custom properties animatable and transitionable, enabling more complex and dynamic visual effects.
Media Queries:
Implementing responsive design principles to adapt styles based on screen size (e.g., changing background color for different viewport widths).
CSS Animation:
Continued practice with @keyframes for creating dynamic visual changes (specifically animating a custom property defined with @property).
